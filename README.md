This project is a simple chess board controllable in the terminal. I created this as practice while re-learning how to code.

In the current version at least, it doesn't work like a chess game online that tells you where you can and can't place a piece, 
but like a chess board in the real world where you can place a piece anywhere. 

How to play:
- A player is asked what they would like to do. If they input 'resign', the game is finished. However, if they input 'move' they are then prompted to select a piece. 
This is done by inputting a coordinate for a piece (for example f7). After this input, they are prompted for a movement coordinate for where the piece will be moved to.
- To take a piece you just move one piece on top of another piece.
- The rest is just chess.

Currently, as this is a very simple chess board, there is no Castling or En passant, both of which I intend to see if I can add in future.
I also would like to see if I can restrict where a piece is able to go.
